    "about": "I'm Arthur Pradier (he/they), I'm 25 and I love to generate pretty pictures! \n\n\n I like to use my skills to create tools that create good looking things, or things that allows non-programmers to easily interact with complex behaviours or functionalities, hence my interest for computer graphics and tools programming. \n\n I also love science fiction, strategy games, narrative experiences, electronic music and OSTs.
